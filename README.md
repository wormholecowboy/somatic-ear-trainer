# somatic-ear-trainer
An idea I had for a new kind of ear trainer for musicians. The idea is to develop a direct connection between what is heard and where the fingers go through using fast feedback cycles. 

This is on the back burner, but I will keep developing it over time. I may use React at some point to make it look nice.
